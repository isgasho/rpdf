# rpdf

`rpdf` aspires to be a fast PDF reader written in Rust, based on the [`webrender`](https://github.com/servo/webrender) project.

## Status

Currently, `rpdf` is in a very early stage, where only a few PDFs will open and render successfully.

So far, I've been using [Ian Lance Taylor's `gold` paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/34417.pdf) for testing.
